// # Java Practice Exercises



// This README includes a series of Java programming prompts to help you practice various Java concepts, including variable declarations, operations, and control structures. Try to solve each prompt and compare your solutions to best practices in Java programming.

// ## Prompt 1: Variable Declaration and Initialization
// - Declare a variable called `myFavoriteNumber`.
// - Assign it a value on the next line.

// ## Prompt 2: Multiple Variable Declarations
// - Declare three different types of variables:
//   - An integer variable.
//   - A constant string variable using `final`.
//   - A variable using `var` (available in Java 10 and later, usable within a method scope).

// ## Prompt 3: Basic Arithmetic Operations
// - Create an integer variable and assign a value to it.
// - Perform the following operations, each on a separate line:
//   - Add a number to your variable.
//   - Subtract a number from your variable.
//   - Multiply your variable by a number.
//   - Divide your variable by a number.
//   - Calculate the remainder of your variable when divided by a number.

// ## Prompt 4: String Manipulation
// - Create a variable called `firstName` and assign it a string that represents your first name.
// - Create another variable called `lastName` and assign it a string that represents your last name.
// - Combine `firstName` and `lastName` to form a `fullName` and print it.

// ## Prompt 5: String Interpolation (Java 15+)
// - Create a variable called `hello` and assign it the string "Hello".
// - Create another variable called `world` and assign it the string "World".
// - Using String formatting or the newer text block feature in Java 15, create a greeting message that integrates both strings into "Hello, World!".

// ## Prompt 6: Comparison and Logical Operators
// - Demonstrate the use of the following operators, each in a separate example:
//   - Equality operator (`==`) to create a statement that is false.
//   - Strict equality (`equals()` method in Java) to create a statement that is true.
//   - Inequality operator (`!=`) to create a statement that is true.
//   - Less than operator (`<`) to create a statement that is false.
//   - Greater than operator (`>`) to create a statement that is false.
//   - Less than or equal to operator (`<=`) to create a statement that is true.
//   - Greater than or equal to operator (`>=`) to create a statement that is false.

// ## Prompt 7: Logical Expressions
// - Use logical and comparison operators to make each of the following statements true:
//   - `a < b` for given variables `a` and `b`.
//   - `c > d` for given variables `c` and `d`.
//   - Comparing two strings for equality using `equals`.
//   - A complex expression using logical AND/OR.

// ## Prompt 8: Array Manipulation
// - Retrieve "Marty McFly" from various structured arrays.
// - Use the length of an array to retrieve the second-to-last item.

// ## Prompt 9: Array and List Modifications
// - Modify elements in arrays or lists, reflecting changes like renaming, age increment, and changing locations.
